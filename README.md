# Sales_SQL_Analysis

## Introduction 
This repository provides a collection of SQL queries designed to track and analyze orders effectively. the purpose of this repository is to explore the data for analytical purposes, and answer differente questions about the sales and orders. 

## Technologies Used

* SQL (Structured Query Language)
* MySQL IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
* MySQL Workbench (Database design and modeling tool)
* MySQL Server (Relational database management system)
  
In this project, I utilized SQL as my primary programming language to analyze and manipulate data. To interact with the databases I used MySQL Workbench As IDE.

## Data Source
The data used in this repository is a randomly generated dataset created specifically for demonstration and testing purposes. It does not represent real-world order data or any actual customer information. The purpose of this synthetic dataset is to provide a simulated environment for developing and testing SQL queries related to order tracking.

The dataset includes randomly generated values for various attributes such as Order ID, product, quantity ordered, price each, order date, and purchase address. please note that while the dataset has been designed to mimic the structure and characteristics of order data, it may not accurately reflect the complexity or variability of real-world scenarios. 

Describes the structure of the database tables used to store order information. It includes details such as Order ID, product, quantity ordered, price each, order date, and purchase address.
